The site contains information aggregated on the following levels:

* World
* Continents
* Country

For the USA and China, data are additionally divided per states and provincies.

Data is updated daily at around 8 a.m. Central European Time.

The numbers presented here are provided only for exploratory and research purposes. The accuracy is based on the source data. Note that different countries use different methods for counting the number of COVID-19 cases.
